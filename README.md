- `ProjectCard` - A reusable component for displaying project information.

- Handling for both images and videos.

### `ProjectsStyles.module.css`

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm start
```
or 
```bash
npm run dev
```


### Customizing the Application

- **`Hero.jsx`**: Modify the text or add additional content to customize the hero section.
- **`Projects.jsx`**: Update the list of projects by adding or removing `ProjectCard` components and adjust their props as needed.
- **`App.css`**: Tweak the global styles and background animations to match your design preferences.

### Adding New Projects

To add a new project:

1. Import the asset (image or video) into `Projects.jsx`.
2. Add a new `ProjectCard` component with the appropriate props:
   ```jsx
   <ProjectCard
     src={newAsset}
     h3="New Project Title"
     p="Description of the new project."
     onButtonClick={() => handleOpenModal({ src: newAsset, h3: "New Project Title", p: "Description of the new project." })}
   />
   ```

### Contact Form

- The `Hero.jsx` component includes a button to show the contact form overlay. Update the `ContactForm` component in the `Contact` directory as needed.
